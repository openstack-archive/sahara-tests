prelude: >
    Stein test templates are now available, while Ocata
    test templates have been removed.
features:
  - A folder with scenario templates for Stein has been added.
    It is a subset of the templates in the main directory.
deprecations:
  - The Ocata-specific job templates have been removed.
    This means that starting from this release Ocata is
    not supported (it is under Extended Maintenance now).
