    Tempest tests now support APIv2.
features:
  - |
    The Tempest plugin provides an APIv2 DataProcessing client and
    tempest tests can be executed against APIv2 too.
    The type of API used is driven by a tempest.conf configuration key
    (data_processing.use_api_v2 for API tests,
    data_processing.api_version_saharaclient for client and CLI tests)
